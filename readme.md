# THE TASKINATOR!

I have long lamented the lack of software that supports both kanban and one-off tasks. While there are some that come close, I haven't found one that is precisely to my liking. Also programming one is my idea of a good time.

When Phase One is complete, it will have the following:
1. Multiple Boards that can have multiple lists
2. Each list can have one or more tasks
3. Each list can have one or more tags
4. Tags have a name and a color
5. These tasks can be dragged and dropped between lists
6. Boards, lists and tasks can be renamed
7. Create tasks outside of a board or tag
8. Tags, consisting of a name and a color, that are shared amongst all lists and boards
9. Mobile-friendly
10. Add and remove tags from tasks
11. The ability to archive boards lists and tags
12. A dashboard modeled after Todoistâ€™s list of tasks
    1. Show a list of boards across the top, scrolling horizontally if necessary
    2. A cloud of tags - clicking one opens a modal that shows all the tasks in that tag, whether affiliated with a board or not
    3. The ability to see all unaffiliated tasks
